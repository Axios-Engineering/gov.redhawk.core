gov.redhawk.interceptor.client:
Contains a CORBA Client interceptor (gov.redhawk.interceptor.client.ClientInterceptor) that verifies that any corba calls are invoked 
outside the of a UI thread.  This ensure the application will always be responsive even if any CORBA calls take a long time.

In order to enable the CORBA UI Interceptor you need to initialize it within the orb :
Add the following to the Connection Properties of the SCADomainManager you would like to test within: 
     Name 	/ 	Value
 - org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.gov.redhawk.interceptor.client.ClientOrbInitializer / ""
 
Or add it to the java system properties. For example on the command line do:
-Dorg.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.gov.redhawk.interceptor.client.ClientOrbInitializer
