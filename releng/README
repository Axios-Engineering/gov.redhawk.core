Due to issues with submodules across multiple branches and remotes, the common PDE Build submodule has been removed.
In order to perform a PDE build in this repository with minimal effort, please also clone the master branch of the
"gov.redhawk.pdebuild.common" repository into the releng/pdebuild path inside this repository.

There are three different build results from the core respository.

common:
  Builds common plugins and features

rcp:
  Builds RCP only, depends on common results.

rap:
  Builds RAP only, depends on common results.

To build:
 - Navigate to the build dir you desire (common, rcp, rap)
 - mvn clean install

Build results are located within the target directories.
